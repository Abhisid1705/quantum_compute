Great question!

The symbol |0⟩ (pronounced "ket zero") comes from Dirac notation, which is used in quantum mechanics to describe quantum states.

✅ Breaking Down the Symbol: |0⟩
| ⟩ is called a "ket" — it represents a column vector, which is how quantum states are written.

0 is the label of the quantum state — in this case, the classical bit value 0.

🧠 What It Really Means:
A qubit in state |0⟩ means it is:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[1]
[0]
This is a vector representing 100% probability of being 0 and 0% probability of being 1.

Similarly:

|1⟩ =

csharp
Copy
Edit
[0]
[1]
Represents 0% chance of being 0, and 100% chance of being 1.

⚡️ Why Notation Matters:
This notation lets us elegantly describe superpositions and quantum operations.

For example:

After applying a Hadamard gate to |0⟩:

We get (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩)

This means the qubit is half 0 and half 1 (in superposition)

🔍 Analogy:
Imagine a coin:

Heads = |0⟩

Tails = |1⟩

A spinning coin = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩) — it's both until you stop and check.

Would you like a visual diagram to show how |0⟩ and |1⟩ look in vector form and how superposition transforms them?
